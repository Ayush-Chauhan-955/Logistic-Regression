**Dive into the fundamentals of binary classification with this focused exploration of Logistic Regression.** This repository provides code implementations and practical examples to help you understand and apply this essential machine learning algorithm.

## üöÄ Quick Look

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/Devanshu-Chauhan-955/Logistic-Regression.git && cd Logistic-Regression`
2.  **Explore:** Browse the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to see Logistic Regression in action on different datasets.
3.  **Run & Learn:** Execute the code to understand the model training, prediction, and evaluation process.

## üìÇ Inside the Project

*   **Notebooks (`*.ipynb`):** Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating Logistic Regression concepts and applications. Expect to find:
    *   Implementation from scratch (potentially).
    *   Usage with libraries like scikit-learn.
    *   Examples on various binary classification datasets.
    *   Visualizations of decision boundaries and performance.
*   **Python Scripts (`*.py`):** Standalone Python scripts focusing on specific aspects of Logistic Regression.
*   **Data (`data/` or similar):** Datasets used for training and evaluating the Logistic Regression models.
*   **Visualizations (`images/` or within notebooks):** Plots and charts illustrating the model's behavior and results.
*   `README.md`: You're reading it!
*   `requirements.txt`: (Likely present) Lists the necessary Python libraries (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
